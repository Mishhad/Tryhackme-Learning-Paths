# 💥 Exploitation Basics — Cybersecurity 101 (TryHackMe)

## 📌 Room Overview
This room introduces the fundamentals of exploitation in cybersecurity — understanding how vulnerabilities are found and exploited by attackers. It covers basic techniques, common vulnerabilities, and practical exploitation using simple tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn what exploitation means in the context of cybersecurity 
- Understand common vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, weak permissions)
- Get hands-on practice exploiting simple services or files
- Learn about popular tools and scripts used for basic exploitation

---

## 🛠️ Key Topics & Tools

| Concept | Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Vulnerability** | Weakness in a system that can be exploited |
| **Exploit** | Code or method used to take advantage of a vulnerability |
| **Buffer Overflow** | A common exploit where excess data overwrites memory |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Gaining higher-level access than intended |
| **Tools Used** | `netcat`, `nc`, `nmap`, simple exploit scripts |

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] Explored the concept of vulnerabilities and exploits
- [x] Practiced using `netcat` to connect to a vulnerable service
- [x] Identified and exploited a basic vulnerability
- [x] Learned how to escalate privileges in a controlled environment
- [x] Completed all tasks in the TryHackMe room

## 🗂️ Notes & Takeaways
- Exploitation is about understanding how systems fail and how to test them ethically.
- Always practice in safe, legal environments like TryHackMe and Hack The Box.
- Basic tools like `nc` and `nmap` are vital for reconnaissance and exploitation.
- Understanding exploits helps defenders protect systems better.
