# 🌐 Networking — Cybersecurity 101 (TryHackMe)

## 📌 Room Overview
This room covers the fundamental concepts of computer networking — an essential building block for any cybersecurity professional. It explains how data moves across networks, common protocols, and basic network troubleshooting tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand key networking concepts (IP addresses, DNS, routing) 
- Learn about common network protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Practice using basic networking tools for reconnaissance and troubleshooting
- Interpret simple network traffic and responses

---

## 🗂️ Key Topics & Tools

| Concept | Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **IP Addressing** | Identifies devices on a network |
| **DNS (Domain Name System)** | Resolves domain names to IP addresses |
| **TCP/UDP** | Core protocols for data transmission |
| **ICMP** | Used for diagnostic tools like `ping` |
| **Ports & Services** | Identify what services run on which ports |

| Tool/Command | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------- |
| `ping` | Test connectivity |
| `traceroute` or `tracert` | Trace the route to a host |
| `nslookup` | Query DNS records |
| `nmap` | Scan open ports and services |

---
