# 🔐 Cryptography — Cybersecurity 101 (TryHackMe)

## 📌 Room Overview
This room introduces the basics of cryptography — a critical concept in cybersecurity. It covers the principles of encryption, decryption, hashing, encoding, and common cryptographic tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the difference between encoding, encryption, and hashing
- Learn about symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption
- Practice decoding and decrypting basic ciphers
- Use online tools and Linux commands to solve crypto challenges 

---

## 🗝️ Key Concepts & Tools Practiced

| Concept | Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Encoding** | Reversible transformation (e.g., Base64) |
| **Encryption** | Secure transformation with a key |
| **Hashing** | One-way transformation (e.g., MD5, SHA256) |
| **Symmetric Encryption** | Same key for encryption and decryption |
| **Asymmetric Encryption** | Public/private key pair |

| Tool/Command | Purpose |
| ------------- | -------- |
| `base64` | Encode/decode Base64 strings |
| `rot13` | Simple substitution cipher |
| `openssl` | Encryption and decryption |
| Online tools | CyberChef, dCode |

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] Encoded and decoded Base64 strings
- [x] Cracked simple ciphers like ROT13 and Caesar cipher
- [x] Used hashing algorithms to verify data integrity
- [x] Applied symmetric and asymmetric encryption concepts
- [x] Completed all TryHackMe room tasks and challenges

## 🗂️ Notes & Takeaways
- Encoding is not encryption — it's just a way to represent data.
- Hashing is irreversible and used for data integrity checks.
- Public key cryptography enables secure communication over insecure channels.
- Tools like CyberChef are essential for quick crypto operations.
