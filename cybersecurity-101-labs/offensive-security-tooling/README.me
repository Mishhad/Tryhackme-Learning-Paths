# ⚔️ Offensive Security & Tooling — Cybersecurity 101 (TryHackMe)

## 📌 Room Overview
This room introduces the basics of offensive security — the practice of ethically attacking systems to identify and fix vulnerabilities. It covers key offensive concepts, attack phases, and commonly used tools for penetration testing and ethical hacking.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand what offensive security means and its importance 
- Learn about the stages of an attack (reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation)
- Get hands-on practice with basic offensive tools
- Perform simple attacks in a controlled lab environment

---

## 🗡️ Key Topics & Tools

| Concept | Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Offensive Security (Red Team)** | Simulates attacks to find weaknesses |
| **Attack Phases** | Reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, covering tracks |
| **Enumeration** | Discovering detailed information about a target |
| **Exploitation** | Using known vulnerabilities to gain access |

| Tool/Command | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------- |
| `nmap` | Scan networks and enumerate services |
| `dirb` | Discover hidden directories |
| `nikto` | Web server scanner |
| `metasploit` | Framework for developing and executing exploits |
| `hydra` | Brute-force login credentials |

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] Learned the key phases of an offensive security engagement
- [x] Practiced information gathering and vulnerability scanning
- [x] Exploited simple vulnerabilities in a test environment
- [x] Explored post-exploitation concepts like privilege escalation
- [x] Completed all tasks in the TryHackMe room

## 🗂️ Notes & Takeaways
- Offensive security helps organizations find and fix security gaps before real attackers do.
- Reconnaissance and enumeration are critical for successful exploitation.
- Tools like `nmap` and `metasploit` are foundational for penetration testing.
- Always practice offensive security ethically and within legal boundaries.
